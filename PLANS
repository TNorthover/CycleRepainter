Tick/cross icon for surface commit/revert
Tooltip for equation entry area
While entering surface, display bases on canvas.
Drag central point around, lines move: need to precompute branches
  whenever eqn changes. Cheap enough?
Surface details greyed when editing paths. Vice versa editing surface.
For branches:
    numpy can give all roots to a univariate polynomial (numpy.roots)
    sympy.discriminant exists, defines branch points.
from sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr:
    ** is expnonentiation (s/^/**/g should be sufficient)
Projection autodetects variables from eqn.
If focus leaves eqn and coords invalid, reset to empty (& stop showing
branches).
Thicker line for selected path
